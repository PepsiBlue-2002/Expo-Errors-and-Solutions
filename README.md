# ExpoErrors&Solutions
The aim here is to condense the many issues and many more possible fixes into one place to help those who may need it in the future.<br>
This project has no affiliation to Expo or any whatever's asscoiated with them and only serves to assist fellow users.<br>
I am not an expert, I'm just pissed off that my app won't load.
